Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1 ,1979 or February 23, 1979) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.


Homer Simpson
Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield and the protagonist of the animated television series The Simpsons.

He is a crude, ignorant, and slobbish individual, although he is fundamentally a good person and shows great caring and loyalty to his family, friends and on occasion, to those he barely knows or those he considers his enemies.

Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abe Simpson II and the late Mona Simpson, but he has two illegitimate half-siblings on Abraham's side.[39][40] . He is married to Marge Simpson and has three children with her: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty Bouvier and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.[41]

Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

Lisa's First Word

When Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa unsuccessfully try to get Maggie to speak, Marge tells the family the story of when Lisa said her first word. Bart asks Marge his first word and a flashback is shown: Homer and Marge were having sex when baby Bart opens the door causing him to shout "Ay, Caramba!" in surprise. Marge then begins telling the story by describing the spring of 1983 as a time when "Ms. Pac-Man struck a blow for women's rights." It's March of 1983, and the Simpson family (minus Lisa and Maggie) originally lived in an apartment complex on the Lower East Side of Springfield. Homer comes home from work singing "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" when Bart happily runs up to his father shouting "Homer." Homer asks Bart to call him "Daddy" but Bart mischievously calls Homer "Dohmer" causing Homer to get outraged and shout his usual catchphrase "Why you little--!" and strangle Bart.
